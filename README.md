# Glass Keep

FORK: Patched all security fixes and implemented all fixes for the issues reported on the original project.

A sleek, Keep-style notes app with Markdown, checklists, images, tag chips, color themes, dark mode, drag-and-drop reordering, import/export, auth, and a glassy UI — built with Vite + React and a tiny Express + SQLite API.

## 📦 Project Structure

```
.
├─ public/                # PWA icons, manifest generated by Vite plugin
├─ src/                   # React app (App.jsx, etc.)

## 🛠 Setup (Development)

### 1) Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# (Optional) only If you don't have these dev/runtime deps yet:
npm install -D concurrently nodemon
npm install express better-sqlite3 cors jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
```

### 2) Run (web + API)

**POSIX/mac/Linux:**
```bash
ADMIN_EMAILS="your-admin-username" npm run dev
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
setx ADMIN_EMAILS "your-admin-username"
npm run dev
```

- Frontend (Vite): http://localhost:5173
- Docker: http://localhost:8080  
  *(Vite dev server proxies `/api` → `http://localhost:8080`.)*

**Promote an existing user to admin (optional):**
```sql
-- Run against server/data.sqlite
UPDATE users SET is_admin=1 WHERE email='your-admin-username';
```

### 3) Docker (Local Development)

**Quick Local Docker Script:**
```bash
./local_docker_run.sh
```

**Or manually:**
```bash
docker build -t glass-keep:local .

docker rm -f glass-keep 2>/dev/null || true

docker run -d \
  --name glass-keep \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e API_PORT=8080 \
  -e JWT_SECRET=dev-please-change \
  -e DB_FILE=/app/data/notes.db \
  -e ADMIN_EMAILS=admin \
  -e ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false \
  -v "$HOME/.glass-keep:/app/data" \ # Change path according to OS (e.g., %USERPROFILE%\.glass-keep on Windows)
  glass-keep:local
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Default Admin Credentials** (for fresh installations):
> - **Username:** `admin`
> - **Password:** `admin`

## 🐳 Docker Deploy to Server(single image: API + built frontend)

### Dockerfile

Your Dockerfile builds the frontend, bundles the API, and runs the Express server that serves both the API and the built UI.

### Build & Run

```bash
# Get the latest image from Docker Hub
docker pull nikunjsingh/glass-keep:latest

# Create data dir
mkdir -p ~/.glass-keep

# (optional) stop/remove any old container
docker rm -f glass-keep 2>/dev/null || true

# Run
docker run -d \
  --name glass-keep \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e API_PORT=8080 \
  -e JWT_SECRET="replace-with-a-long-random-string" \
  -e DB_FILE="/app/data/notes.db" \
  -e ADMIN_EMAILS="your-admin-username" \
  -e ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false \
  -v ~/.glass-keep:/app/data \
  nikunjsingh/glass-keep:latest

```

- App & API: http://localhost:8080  
- **Admin Panel (Docker/prod):** http://localhost:8080/#/admin  
  *(Make sure `ADMIN_EMAILS` matches the username exactly when creating the admin account)*

### docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  app:
    image: nikunjsingh/glass-keep:latest
    container_name: glass-keep
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
      API_PORT: "8080"
      JWT_SECRET: replace-with-a-long-random-string
      DB_FILE: /app/data/notes.db
      ADMIN_EMAILS: your-admin-username  # <— change this to your admin user
      ALLOW_REGISTRATION: "false"        # <— set to "true" to allow new account creation
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - /home/YOURUSER/.glass-keep:/app/data   # <— change this to your actual home path username
```

Run:

```bash
mkdir -p /home/YOURUSER/.glass-keep
docker compose up -d
```

> **Persistent data:** notes DB lives in the mounted `./data` folder on your host.

## 🧭 Using the Admin Panel

- **Where**
  - Dev: http://localhost:5173/#/admin
  - Docker/Prod: http://localhost:8080/#/admin
- **Who can access**: Users with `is_admin = 1`.
  - Auto-promote by setting `ADMIN_EMAILS="your-admin-username"` before starting the server/container, **or**
  - Run a one-off SQL update:
    ```sql
    UPDATE users SET is_admin=1 WHERE email='your-admin-username';
    ```
> **Note:** If registration is disabled (default), you can use the default admin account to log in for the first time:
> - **Username:** `admin`
> - **Password:** `admin`
> 
> After logging in, you can create new users or change the admin password in the Admin Panel.
- **What you can do**
  - View all users with: **Is Admin**, **Notes count**, **Storage used**, **Created at**
  - **Delete** a user (also removes their notes; cannot delete the last admin)

> The admin view is intentionally not in the main header menu. Navigate to the route directly.

  * For text notes: Enter a *Title* and content.
  * For checklists: Add checklist items and toggle them as needed.

  * Add **tags** (comma-separated) — they become chips.
  * Choose a **color**, attach **images**, then click **Add Note**.

* **Markdown editing**

  * Use the **Formatting** button (Aa) in the composer or modal edit mode:

    * H1/H2/H3, **bold**, *italic*, ~~strike~~, `inline code`, `fenced code`, quote, lists, link
  * **Smart Enter** continues lists or exits on empty line.

* **Open / Edit**

  * Click a card to open the modal.

  * Images are compressed client-side on upload.

* **Pin & Reorder**

  * Use the pin icon on a card or modal header.
  * Drag cards to reorder within **Pinned** or **Others**.
  * **Drag checklist items** to reorder them within a checklist note. ✅ NEW
  * **Toggle checklist items** directly from the notes grid without opening the modal. ✅ NEW

  * Open the **hamburger menu** → sidebar lists all tags + counts.
  * Quick filters: **Notes (All)**, **All Images**.

* **Search & AI Assistance** ✅ NEW
  * **Deep Search**: Searches across title, Markdown text, tags, checklist items, and image names.
  * **AI Assistant**: Press **Enter** in the search bar to ask questions about your notes.

## 🔐 Security Notes

* Treat your **Secret Key** like a password. Anyone with it can sign in as you.
* Change `JWT_SECRET` in production to a long, random string.
* Serve over HTTPS in production for PWA and security best practices.

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

* **Dev proxy error (`ECONNREFUSED` to `/api`)**

  * Ensure the API is running on `:8080` (`npm run dev` starts both).
* **Docker runs but CSS looks wrong**

  * Rebuild after Tailwind config changes: `docker compose build --no-cache`.
  * Ensure the app is built (`npm run build`) before running the Node server image.
* **PWA “Install” doesn’t appear**

  * Use the built preview (`npm run preview`) or serve production build over HTTPS.
  * Check DevTools → Application → Manifest & Service Worker for errors.
